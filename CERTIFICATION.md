## 1. App Functionality

The app includes five thematic presentations and one overview presentation.
Each presentation is built on a single dataset sourced from the Statistics Norway (SSB) API.
Visualizations are primarily time series line charts, with interactive slicers for filtering by period, dimensions, and statistical variables.

## 2. Data Source

All data is retrieved from the official SSB API.
The API is publicly accessible and does not require authentication.
No personal or sensitive data is collected, stored, or processed.

## 3. Security and Privacy

The app does not transmit or store user data.
It operates entirely within the Power BI environment using read-only API calls.
Privacy and security documentation is provided via GitHub wiki links.

## 4. Support and Maintenance

Support is offered via email (info@byggkpi.no) and GitHub Issues.
No service-level guarantees are provided; support is offered on a best-effort basis.
The app may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the SSB API or improve functionality.
