# Byggekostnadindeks.pbix

This Power BI file shows an example about how to get data from Statistics Norway ([SSB](https://www.ssb.no/)). The selected table is [08651: Byggekostnadsindeks for bustader i alt, etter arbeidstype (2015=100)](https://www.ssb.no/statbank/table/08651). This table shows the index monthly.

The script for the query was obtained with the use of [Q4OpenData](https://stat.qumio.com/) - query for open data. The query was adapted to allow that with the refresh of data it gets from the API the latest updated month.

More information about [SSB API](https://www.ssb.no/api) can be found on its website.
