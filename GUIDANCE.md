# User Guidance for the Power BI App

This document provides instructions for using the Power BI app, which includes five presentations, one dataset, and one overview presentation. The app is designed to visualize statistical data retrieved from the Statistics Norway (SSB) API.

## Overview of the App Structure

- **Presentations**: The app contains five thematic presentations.
- **Dataset**: A single dataset sourced from the SSB API serves as the foundation for all visualizations.
- **Content Overview**: An additional presentation provides a summary of the app's structure and content.

## Presentation Pages

Each presentation consists of multiple pages. Every page is connected to a single table from the SSB API and displays time series data using line charts. These charts illustrate one or more statistical variables over time.

### Page Components

- **Line Charts**: Visualize trends and changes in statistical variables across time.
- **Slicers**: Interactive filters that allow users to customize the view:
  - **Period Selector**: Filter data by specific time ranges.
  - **Dimension Filters**: Narrow down data by categories such as region, industry, or other relevant dimensions.
  - **Variable Filters**: Select specific statistical variables to display.

## How to Use the App

1. **Navigate Presentations**: Use the navigation pane to access different presentations.
2. **Interact with Filters**: Use slicers to refine the data displayed in each chart.
3. **Analyze Trends**: Observe patterns and insights from the time series visualizations.
4. **Review Content Overview**: Refer to the overview presentation for a summary of available content and structure.

## Notes

- All data is retrieved dynamically from the SSB API.
- The app does not store or process personal data.
