## Overview of the App

This Power BI application provides interactive visualizations based on publicly available datasets from Statistics Norway (SSB). It is designed to help users explore key performance indicators and trends relevant to the construction industry and related sectors.

The app includes five thematic presentations, one consolidated dataset, and a content overview. Each presentation offers multiple pages with time series charts and filtering options to support data-driven decision-making.
